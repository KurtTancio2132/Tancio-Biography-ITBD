            <h2>Childhood Years</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Kurt David V. Tancio, and I’m 20 years old, turning 21 this August 20.<sup>1</sup> 
                I was born in Manila on that date in 2004, but my hometown is San Mateo, Rizal, where I grew up for 20 years.<sup>2</sup> 
                We moved to different houses within San Mateo, but it always felt like home.<sup>3</sup> 
                My childhood memories in San Mateo are some of my best, especially since I witnessed the transformation of the area from a province to a city.<sup>4</sup> 
                Living in the province had its charm, but things changed as it grew into a bustling urban environment.<sup>5</sup> 
                As a child, I was always immersed in gaming, especially FPS and MOBA games like Counter-Strike, Dota, and Battle Realms.<sup>6</sup> 
                I can still vividly remember the excitement of having my first computer set up for gaming.<sup>7</sup> 
                My mother would always scold me when I played for too long, but I couldn’t help myself.<sup>8</sup> 
                Despite the scoldings, my mother and I have a very close relationship.<sup>9</sup> 
                I always tell her about my day, whether it was good or bad, and I’m never shy around her.<sup>10</sup> 
                On the other hand, my relationship with my father is more distant.<sup>11</sup> 
                We don’t talk much, except when I need to ask for my allowance.<sup>12</sup> 
                It’s not that I don’t love him, but we’re simply not as close as I am with my mother.<sup>13</sup> 
                I attended Eastern Star Academy for preschool and grade school, where I learned valuable lessons about friendship and decision-making.<sup>14</sup> 
                Growing up, I didn’t have many friends since I was an introvert, mostly focused on my games.<sup>15</sup> 
                But that didn’t bother me because the games helped me develop important skills like hand-eye coordination, logic, and problem-solving.<sup>16</sup> 
                Even now, when I face challenges, I often apply the logic and decision-making skills I honed while gaming.<sup>17</sup> 
                Looking back, I see how my gaming experiences shaped who I am today, especially in how I approach problem-solving.<sup>18</sup>

            <h2>Teenage Years</h2>
            <p>
                <sup>1</sup> My teenage years were some of the best experiences of my life. 
                From Grade 7 to 10, I wasn’t an honor student I was more of an average student. 
                <sup>2</sup> In Grade 7, I was just enjoying my life as a first-time high school student, so my grades were around 80-85. 
                <sup>3</sup> In Grade 7, I developed an interest in playing basketball, volleyball, and chess. 
                <sup>4</sup> Thankfully, I made it to our high school basketball team, and from there, I enjoyed playing basketball more than studying. 
                <sup>5</sup> From Grade 7 to 9, I played basketball, but in the middle of Grade 8, I got cut from my basketball team because my grades were failing. 
                <sup>6</sup> I needed to improve my grades to return to the team. 
                <sup>7</sup> Getting cut from the team humbled me because, even though I was performing very well and winning some awards, they still cut me. 
                <sup>8</sup> It was a valuable lesson for me. 
                <sup>9</sup> I learned how to manage my time and prioritize what’s important. 
                <sup>10</sup> During my varsity years, the school gave us an allowance to spend on important things like maintenance for our bodies, face, etc. 
                <sup>11</sup> But as a dumb kid, I ended up spending it on less important things like video game skins and going out with friends. 
                <sup>12</sup> I eventually learned how to control it. 
                <sup>13</sup> When I got back on the team, I felt like a new person because I had learned my lesson. 
                <sup>14</sup> The principal and my mother were very close, and they both scolded me for about two quarters. 
                <sup>15</sup> But I'm very thankful for them because it changed my perspective on life.
                <sup>16</sup> Then Grade 10 came, and everything was going fine. 
                <sup>17</sup> I was graduating from high school, and then all of a sudden, my mother got sick, and COVID happened. 
                <sup>18</sup> This chapter in my life was the most depressing part. 
                <sup>19</sup> My mother had cancer, and because of COVID, my siblings and I couldn’t visit the hospital. 
                <sup>20</sup> We couldn’t even show her how much we loved her or support her in person. 
                <sup>21</sup> We always did video calls, but it wasn’t enough. 
                <sup>22</sup> Of course, as her children, we wanted to see her in person, not just on a screen. 
                <sup>23</sup> We wanted to take care of her. 
                <sup>24</sup> Fast forward through a couple of depressing months about two to three months. 
                <sup>25</sup> In the first month, my mother came home. 
                <sup>26</sup> The doctor said she could stay home, and since hospital expenses were extremely high, we decided to bring her home before the bills piled up. 
                <sup>27</sup> When she came home, we all cried every day, especially me. 
                <sup>28</sup> I'm a mama’s boy, and I love her so much. 
                <sup>29</sup> Seeing her lying in bed with a machine attached to her body so she could eat, breathe, drink, and pee broke my heart. 
                <sup>30</sup> Whenever I imagine or dream of it, sometimes I cry because it was the most painful phase of my life.
                <sup>31</sup> In the second month, she started experiencing hair loss, which is normal for cancer patients. 
                <sup>32</sup> Then came the blood vomiting and other complications. 
                <sup>33</sup> In the third month, my mother passed away. 
                <sup>34</sup> My heart was shattered into pieces. 
                <sup>35</sup> I didn’t know how to act, what to feel, or what to say. 
                <sup>36</sup> She was my best friend and my mother. 
                <sup>37</sup> Fast forward, she was buried, and I started losing interest in basketball and video games. 
                <sup>38</sup> But then I started recovering because I realized that I wasn’t the only one grieving. 
                <sup>39</sup> My family was also grieving, and that motivated me to study and return to my hobbies. 
                <sup>40</sup> At this time, I was a Grade 11 student. 
                <sup>41</sup> I graduated online from my previous school and then studied at Arellano University for two years. 
                <sup>42</sup> I chose the ICT strand. 
                <sup>43</sup> I only chose it because my father is also in IT, and I wanted to give it a try. 
                <sup>44</sup> Then it piqued my interest because it’s very tech-savvy, and the world is advancing, so I thought, why not try it? 
                <sup>45</sup> Two years passed, and I graduated from senior high school at Arellano University.
                <sup>46</sup> I also met a very pretty and cute woman from Philippine Women’s University. 
                <sup>47</sup> We met in a UV Express, a public transport service. 
                <sup>48</sup> Her friend approached me when I was about to get off and asked for my name and socials. 
                <sup>49</sup> At first, I was hesitant to message her back because she had messaged me first, hehe. 
                <sup>50</sup> Then I realized she looked familiar because she was also from San Mateo, and we were both athletes. 
                <sup>51</sup> I stalked her a little, then we talked, dated, and worked out together. 
                <sup>52</sup> We had many similar interests. 
                <sup>53</sup> The little things like that made me happy. 
                <sup>54</sup> Now, here we are both in our second year of college, pursuing the courses we chose. 
                <sup>55</sup> I wish and pray that she becomes very successful. 
                <sup>56</sup> I want to give her everything she wants. 
                <sup>57</sup> A little backstory our childhoods were quite different. 
                <sup>58</sup> I was spoiled, while she was the "minsan lang makuha ang gusto" type. 
                <sup>59</sup> So whenever we go out, I always make sure to treat her and give her what she wants. 
                <sup>60</sup> I really hope she is the one I will marry in the future. 
                <sup>61</sup> I guess this is what love does to people.

            <h2>College Years</h2>
            <p><p>College life so far my experience at the University of the East has been a little tough.<sup>1</sup> Back in Arellano University, when I chose the ICT strand, they didn’t have the lab or equipment to teach us properly.<sup>2</sup> I don’t know if the problem was the teacher or the equipment, but for the whole two years, I didn’t learn much.<sup>3</sup> I only learned the basics.<sup>4</sup> That’s why I’m having a tough time in UE right now.<sup>5</sup> But I have friends in UE who are always willing to help whenever I don’t understand the instructions or what to do.<sup>6</sup> They are always there, and I’m very thankful for them.<sup>7</sup> I wish and pray that my friends and I graduate together, even though we are struggling.<sup>8</sup> I also hope to learn the things I need to be a successful IT professional in the near future.<sup>9</sup> I’m pursuing this for myself and my family, especially for my mother.<sup>10</sup> I want to make her proud.<sup>11</sup> I want to learn everything about IT, whatever it takes.<sup>12</sup></p>
